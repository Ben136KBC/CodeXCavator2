This is a repository for CodeXCavator2, a code indexing and search tool.

To use it, simply download the Deploy directory and run the CodeXCavator.exe in there. No installation or registration or adminitrator rights is required.

CodeXCavator is essentially CodeXCavator (see https://sourceforge.net/p/codexcavator/wiki/Home/) but with a number of changes made by Ben van der Merwe. The changes are as follows:

- Searching is case insensitive by default.
- Application remembers its previous location and size when opened.
- The main view has a button to update the current index.
- The main view has a button to create a new simple index.
- If no index is specified on the command line, a view is open which allows the user to select an existing index, select a recent index, or create a new simple index.
- The last index used is remembered and can be opened by default. There is an option for this on the main view.
- The search results view (bottom right) has been changed slightly to fit the headings for each result onto one row, allowing more results to be shown.
- Support for Fortran with a highlighter.

The changes were not made to the original CodeXCavator, because it suits the needs of the original author as is, and he is concerned about changes possibly breaking something. As required by the license agreement, modified files in this archive are clearly marked. This version is released under the same license agreement as the original.

Things I intend to work on:
- Find the definition of something in the code.
- Add to PortableApps
- Sorting amongst results
